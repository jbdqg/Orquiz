A quiz is composed by:
- Quiz attributes
- Several Questions for each Quiz
- Several Answers for each Question

Each Quiz or Question can have a url to an image associated with it ("quiz_url" or "question_url"), that should point to an accessible url.

When a quiz is uploaded each image is asynchronously downloaded and stored in the directory Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/orquiz/quizes/" of your device to make it usable even when the device is offline.
It is advisable to have wifi internet connection when uploading a quiz.

Bellow is a commented structure of the options available for you to use when defining a new quiz.
