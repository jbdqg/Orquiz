    "quiz_description": "Nineteen Eighty-Four is set in Oceania, one of three inter-continental superstates that divided the world after a global war. Most of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of Airstrip One\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\". Posters of the Party leader, Big Brother, bearing the caption \"BIGBROTHERISWATCHINGYOU\", dominate the city, while the ubiquitous telescreen (transceiving television set) monitors the private and public lives of the populace.",
